# Add a new language (`locale`), with a fallback to English (or another language)

Just to go over the basics, this is how to add any new locale to the site.

1. Go to settings > locale
2. Click "add a locale"
3. Click "enable" under "synchronise" and select English â€” this is the fallback that @conatus was talking about.
  - You could select  a different language to synchronise from, if you prefer not to fall back to English for a certain locale.
  - This ensures that all the normal pages (e.g. Map, Logbook Index, etc.) show up
  - It also allows users to switch between different translations of existing pages that haven't been translated under the new locale yet

### 2. Delete the locale now that there are no French pages depending on it

# Create a page in the contributor's own language

You can create a new page in any locale, as long as you've added it at the global level (see above). The system does not particularly bias English as a language, except that it is what the standard index pages were created in.

1. In the sidebar, select Pages > Atlas [your desired locale]
2. Add child pages as normal. The pages will be created in this new language.
