# How does the tag cloud work?

## What is the tag cloud?

The tag cloud is displayed on the [main page of the website](https://atlas.smartforests.net/en-gb/). It is also displayed on the footer of most other pages, for example on [Logbooks](https://atlas.smartforests.net/en/logbooks/cop26/) and [contributor pages](https://atlas.smartforests.net/en/contributors/danilo-urzedo/).

It is a way in which people navigate the site and is intended to display the inter-relation between topics and the topic of smart forests as a whole.

Authors of the Atlas select tags for content they add to the Atlas based on their understanding of the topic at hand. These tags are then mapped to one another to display this tag cloud.

## Design goals of the tag cloud

The tag cloud is intended to do three things.

1. Work out which topics are more central to the material on the site.
2. Work out how topics are related to one another.
3. Show this visually.

we want to show the absolute centrality of a topic and the relative centrality of a topic and the set of topics that are related to it. These topics are defined by user selected tags, where a researcher draws on their knowledge of a topic in order to tag it appropriately.
